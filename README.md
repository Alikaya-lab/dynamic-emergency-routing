# dynamic-emergency-routing

This project focuses on implementing advanced graph algorithms
to simulate real-time emergency vehicle routing in a dynamic city network.

The system will include:
- Graph representation
- Dijkstra Algorithm
- A* Algorithm
- Dynamic traffic simulation
- Performance comparison
